              At AvantStay, I served as a Frontend and Mobile Developer focusing on React Native. My role involved
              building robust, cross-platform mobile applications that deliver seamless user experiences across iOS and
              Android. By collaborating closely with designers, product managers, and backend engineers, I ensured every
              feature was implemented with efficiency, scalability, and a user-first mindset.
